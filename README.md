# SocketBots

"SocketBots" use the power of websockets (SocketIO), modular AI teams (CrewAI, LangChain), and multithreading adjacency to provide a more seamless interaction with your AI.

## Features
- Maintain conversation with your main AI personality while crews of Agents work in the background.
- Asynchronous Tool calls from main AI.
- SQLlite database for conversations
- More to come
SocketBots is meant to be an easy to set up AI teams using a Nuxt.js UI. Once crew's are defined in the server, you can either let your main AI delegate to them, or give them tasks manually from the UI.
